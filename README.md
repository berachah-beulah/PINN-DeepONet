# PINN-DeepONet

A deep learning framework for monotonic and physics-compliant CO2 trapping index forecasting

Blessing Afolayan, Paschal Ogechukwu Amaechi and Mimonitu Opuwari

This repository contains the implementation of a Physics-Incorporated approach (DeepONet) to assess the prediction of density-induced trapping effectiveness, where custom layers were utilised as strict boundaries, a physics-based loss function was implemented through non-linear equations, with the introduction of a feature attention component, output heads (dual), cross-attention fusion, and spectral normalisation for learning stability.
